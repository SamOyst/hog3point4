The end goal is to have an accessible webpage and one of two things will likely occur
    - Woodland Conservation will have to host front+backend on a pc (Not highly likely)
    - Woodland Conservation will have to put the front and backend up on a server to be hosted

Running a backend through node.js with some help from express (a tool for node.js)
    - Installed express in backend (generated node_modules and the package-lock)
    - Installed cors, configured project to run on port 4000 and cors to only accept input from port 4000
    - Axios will let us make requests

To run:
    - install npm
    - npm install express
    - NPM run dev - runs the vite app as developper
    - cd src/backend - moves to the backend folder
    - node server.js - starts the server
    - http://localhost:4000/admin for admin page
